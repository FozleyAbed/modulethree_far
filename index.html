			Livestock especially poultry is a promising sector for poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Approximately 140 millions chickens are scattered throughout 68 000 villages in the country mostly of indigenous non-descript type. The production system for indigenous chickens is smallholder backyard scavenging in nature with each family keeping an average of 6-7 chickens to meet family requirements and from which a cash income can also be derived when necessary. Indigenous chickens produce about 75% of the eggs and 78% of the meat consumed domestically. Among said indigenous chicken genetic resources non-descript Deshi Aseel and Naked Neck breeds are noteworthy.The non-descript Deshi chicken constitutes about 90% of the indigenous population. Also known as ‘Murghi’ they have undergone unknown periods of natural selection and are a reservoir of excellent genetic diversity. They show high levels of morphological and phenotypic variability and increased fitness under natural settings. Studies reveal that they may be regarded as one breed or population because of the small genetic distances among them. Deshi chickens are characterized by black (75%) and red (25%) plumage colour; black (39%) yellow (32%) and white (29%) shank color; black (99%) eye color; bright red (59%) and pale (41%) comb colour; white (82%) and yellow (17%) skin colour; no definite (61%) and lacing (17%) feather pattern; medium (70%) and large (19%) body size; single comb (97%) and rudimentary spur (98%); medium egg size (80%); light brown (67%) and white (27%) egg shell colour. Regarding production traits Deshi chickens have average hatch weight of 29 g; body weight at 4 8 12 weeks;elit cursus.

			Beef

			The original cattle bought to Australia with the first fleet in 1788 were intended to assist with development of the country. However, they escaped and their numbers increased rapidly until cattle farming became commercial. This commercialisation was strengthened by the gold rushes of the 1850’s where demand for beef in inland areas increased greatly. One person who profited from this was the great Sir Sidney Kidman who originally opened a butcher shop and later became the largest landholder in the world, at that time. Landholders such as Kidman walked cattle vast distances to market and pastures. Originally many of these cattle perished as they were unable to handle Australian conditions. After years of animal and breed selection animal survival is much higher as different cattle breeds are used depending on their survivability. Today, Cattle farmers in Australia collectively run 28 million cattle across 200 million hectares. The number of cattle in Australia makes it a relatively small producer on a global scale. However, due to its small population, Australia exports around 60% of produce making it the world’s second largest beef exporter behind Brazil. Australia prides itself on producing superior quality beef that is free from diseases. Beef quality is determined by the size of the cuts produced from an animal and the marbling of the beef. The quality of product from Australian beef can be broadly segregated based on the breed of animal. Bos Indicus cattle are generally selected by northern producers due to their hardiness, tick resistance and ability to cope with heat. The beef produced from these animals is typically of lower quality than beef produced from Bos Taurus animals.

			Sushi

			Since the 1990s sushi has become a global product with a transnational market. Hybridised and localised sushi like California Rolls and Spider Rolls are now even being reverse-imported to Japan as ‘genuine American sushi’. This article examines some attempts to re-nationalise global sushi, both from the Japanese state and from the vernacular media. We argue that, while popular reporting on the ‘overseas sushi boom’ generates a sense of national pride over ‘them’ eating ‘our’ food, the state's position is a more strategic one. It operates with a clear motive of increasing sales of Japanese food products overseas, mobilising the image of authenticity for this specific purpose.. Sushi is a traditional Japanese food, mostly consisting of rice and raw fish. Fish is considered  healthy food as with other product, consumption of raw muscle incurs potential health risks such as ingestion of pathogenic bacteria or parasites. In this study, 250 sushi samples were analyzed for their microbiological status and the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria. A comparison was made between frozen sushi from supermarkets and fresh sushi from sushi bars. Aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts differed for sushi from these two sources, with means of 2.7 log CFU/g for frozen sushi and 6.3 log CFU/g for fresh sushi. The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was higher in the fresh samples. Salmonella was found in four (1.6%) of the sushi samples, and Listeria monocytogenes was found in three (1.2%) of the samples. These results indicate that the microbiological quality of industrially processed sushi is higher than that of freshly prepared sushi. The quality of freshly prepared sushi strongly depends on the skills and habits of the preparation cooks.
